# DorfmanAlf
Implementation of the Dorfman and Alf algorithm for ROC (Reciever Operating Characteristic) curves in C++ (Visual Studio). This program was developed based on the work of the following papers regarding Binormal ROC curves.

1) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2496(69)90019-4 Maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters of signal-detection theory and determination of confidence intervalsâ€”Rating-method data- Donald D. Dorfman, Edward Alf Jr.

2) http://doi:10.1016/0022-2496(72)90009-0 Some aspects of ROC curve-fitting: Normal and logistic models- D.R Grey, B.J.T Morgan.

This code uses code from Numerical Recipes in C as well as other code for approximating values for the standard normal distribution and random number generation.
